    <p>
        The Language Archive Cologne (LAC) supports research, learning and
        teaching with high quality and dependable digital language
        resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The LAC facilitates free and open online access to research data. It
        does this by preserving digital audio and video data, annotations,
        and other digital language data in the long term, and by promoting
        and disseminating these resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The LAC promotes open and sustainable practices in the use of
        digital language data in the humanities and provides technical
        advice to the research community, and supports the deployment of
        digital technologies in research and teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following this, the mission of the LAC repository is to serve as the
        repository of a CLARIN-D resource centre. The mission of CLARIN-D is
        to provide “linguistic data, tools and services in an integrated,
        interoperable and scalable infrastructure for the social sciences
        and humanities“ (<a href="http://de.clarin.eu/en/home-en.html" title="CLARIN-EU" target="_blank">http://de.clarin.eu/en/home-en.html</a>).
        Therefore, a repository in which data, tools and according
        metadata is archived on a long term basis has to be operated by such
        a resource centre.
